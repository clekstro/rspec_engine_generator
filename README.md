# Rspec::Engine::Generator

Simple Thor based gem that lets you easily create a Rails 3 engine.
Standard Rails prefers TestUnit and it's not obvious or trivial to set
things up yourself, so I've bundled together great ideas from
http://brainbicycle.net/blog/2011/10/03/create-a-rails-engine-with-rspec-and-capybara-tests
and elsewhere and tried to make this simple and easy.

## Installation

  $ gem install rspec-engine-generator
