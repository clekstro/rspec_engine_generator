add good examples of most things you'd want to configure, commented out in the generated app
  - routing calls. when to use engine.resources_path main_app.something_path
  - how to setup EngineName.configure do |config| blocks

add rspec lines to generator in engine so if you generate models it'll use rspec instead of test unit
